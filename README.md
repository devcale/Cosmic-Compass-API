# Usage & API Documentation

## Relevant Configuration
The project is configured to run on localhost port 7183 by default. You can change this by modifying the applicationURL parameter on the `launchSettings.json` file.

In order to connect to your own Redis Database, you will need to update the environment variables. You should add:
- `ASPNETCORE_REDISPASS`: Your Redis connection password.
- `ASPNETCORE_REDISURL`: Your Redis connection url.
- `ASPNETCORE_REDISPORT`: The port you have setup for Redis.
